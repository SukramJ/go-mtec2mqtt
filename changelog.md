# Version 1.0.0 (2026-05-25)

## What's Changed

First release of `go-mtec2mqtt` — a pure-Go port of the Python
[`aiomtec2mqtt`](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiomtec2mqtt) bridge for
the M-TEC Energybutler hybrid PV/battery inverter. Same YAML config,
same MQTT topic layout, same Home Assistant entities — drop-in
replacement for the Python daemon.

### Added

- **Modbus-TCP transport** with an own MBAP codec (`internal/modbus/protocol`)
  validated bit-for-bit against `pymodbus 3.13` goldenfile vectors. Sequential
  request/reply on a single TCP connection, per-call context deadline,
  connection poisoning on I/O errors so the watchdog can reconnect.
- **Pure-Go MQTT 3.1.1 client** (TCP + TLS, QoS 0/1 with PUBACK
  tracking, LWT, keepalive ping, subscription replay on reconnect)
  lifted from [`openccu-loom`](https://github.com/SukramJ/openccu-loom).
  Exponential backoff lifecycle wrapper, no external dependencies.
- **Register catalog** (`registers.yaml`) ported verbatim from
  `aiomtec2mqtt` — 94 register definitions including STR / BYTE / BIT
  / DAT types, scaling factors, value-items maps for select/enum
  registers and Home Assistant device-class hints.
- **Type-aware decoders** for every Modbus data type the inverter
  exposes (U16/S16/U32/S32/BYTE/BIT/DAT/STR), byte-for-byte
  compatible with the Python coordinator's output shape.
- **Address clustering** that folds nearby registers into single
  Modbus reads (gap ≤ 10) so the inverter's slow Modbus stack stays
  responsive.
- **Coordinator orchestration** with one polling goroutine per group
  (`base` / `config` / `secondary` round-robin / `day` / `total` /
  `static`), driven by the existing `REFRESH_*` config keys.
- **Pseudo-registers**: `consumption`, `api_date`, `consumption_day`,
  `autarky_rate_day`, `own_consumption_day`, plus the corresponding
  `*_total` set — formulas identical to the Python coordinator with
  zero-denominator guards so a brand-new day never produces `NaN`.
- **Home Assistant auto-discovery** (`internal/hass`) — emits
  `sensor` / `binary_sensor` / `number` / `select` / `switch`
  payloads with the same topic layout (`<hass_base>/<platform>/MTEC_<key>/config`)
  the upstream Python daemon uses, so HA dashboards keep working
  unchanged. 98 discovery entries from the shipped catalog.
- **Write-back path** for HA `select` / `number` / `switch`
  interactions: value-items reverse-lookup (label → code), scaling,
  uint16 narrowing — all matching the Python `WriteRegisterByMQTT`
  semantics.
- **YAML configuration** with the full schema from `aiomtec2mqtt`
  (every field documented in `config-template.yaml`) plus runtime
  override via `MTEC_<KEY>` env vars. `MQTT_FLOAT_FORMAT` translated
  from Python format specs (`{:.3f}`) to Go fmt verbs (`%.3f`).
- **Config locator** that walks `./config.yaml` → `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aiomtec2mqtt/`
  → `$APPDATA/aiomtec2mqtt/` → `~/.config/aiomtec2mqtt/` so an
  existing Python install can swap binaries without moving files.
- **Watchdog-driven reconnect**: Modbus transport poisons the
  connection on any I/O error; the watchdog re-dials on a 5 s tick.
  MQTT lifecycle handles its own reconnect with exponential backoff
  and replays every registered subscription.
- **Interactive register CLI** (`mtec-util`) for listing the
  catalog, reading a single register or a whole group, and writing
  a value (with confirmation prompt). Works without a Modbus
  connection for the listing options.
- **Daemon entry point** (`mtec2mqtt`) with `--config`,
  `--registers`, `--version` flags and `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` graceful
  shutdown via `signal.NotifyContext`.
- **Multi-stage Docker build** producing a statically-linked
  `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot` image (CGO disabled).
  `/config` volume + `XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/config` so
  `docker run -v ./my-config:/config:ro` Just Works.
- **Makefile** with the usual targets (`build` / `test` /
  `test-cover` / `vet` / `fmt` / `fmt-check` / `check` / `docker`)
  plus build-info injection via `-ldflags`.
- **GitHub Actions CI** running `go vet` + `gofumpt -l` (lint),
  `go test -race` matrix across Linux / macOS / Windows, and a
  build smoke that checks the `--version` banner.
- **Tag-triggered release workflow**: pushing a `X.Y.Z` (or
  `vX.Y.Z`) tag extracts the matching changelog section, cross-
  compiles binaries for `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `darwin/arm64`,
  and attaches them as release assets.

### Test coverage

~165 tests across 9 packages, all `-race`-clean. Highlights:

- Modbus codec: 23 sub-tests against 13 `pymodbus`-generated
  goldenfile vectors (request/response/exception for FC03 + FC06).
- Modbus transport: 11 tests with an in-process mock Modbus-TCP
  server, including concurrent-reads-are-serialised, timeout-
  poisoning, FC06 echo mismatch.
- Register catalog: 4 loader tests (incl. smoke against the real
  `registers.yaml`), 16 decoder tests covering every data type and
  the sign-extension boundaries, 10 clustering tests.
- Config loader: 10 tests including ENV-override coercion, format-
  spec translation, multi-error aggregation.
- HA discovery: 11 tests + smoke against the real catalog (98
  entries, all round-trip through `json.Unmarshal` cleanly).
- Coordinator: 7 integration tests with stub transports covering
  STATIC init, pseudo-register publication, enum conversion, HA
  discovery, inbound `/set` command handling, watchdog reconnect,
  fail-fast-on-connect.
- MQTT transport: 35 tests inherited from `openccu-loom` covering
  the full lifecycle, codec, and reconnect scenarios.

### Verified

End-to-end against a live M-TEC Energybutler GEN3 (firmware
V27.53.5.0) and a Mosquitto broker:

- STATIC init reads `serial_no`, `firmware_version`, `equipment_info`
  correctly.
- 98 retained HA discovery entries published; HA picks up every
  entity.
- All six poll loops cycle on the configured cadence; pseudo-
  registers published alongside the raw values.
- Clean shutdown on `SIGTERM` — Modbus and MQTT both disconnect
  gracefully without leaving the inverter holding half-open sockets.
